There are great cafes, excellent restaurants, nice galleries, a glass blowers studio, a jewellery gallery, an antiques emporium to browse. Lots of artists live here. It is also a famous rock climbing destination. Centennial Glen is where you can start but there are many climbs around the district. There is a lovely swimming pool in a beautiful park with free BBQs near by, when it is hot and a golf course just 250 metres away. It is only ten minutes drive (or a short train or bus ride) to the more touristy Katoomba with it''s larger supermarkets, interesting Cultural Centre and Art Gallery. The Scenic Railway and Three Sisters are here. In the other direction the Jenolan Caves are one hour bus ride (they will pick you up and drop you off in Blackheath) or you can drive. Mt Vic Flicks is a short drive away. It is open Thursday-Sunday. It is an old fashioned cinema and a locals favourite.
